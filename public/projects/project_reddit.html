            <div class="content" style="display: block;">
                <p>A Reddit forum on the topic of eating disorders ('r/proED/') was closed in 2018 due to content policy violation. At the time, this forum was the largest subreddit on this topic.</p>
                <p>This project explores the consequences of this wholesale shutdown on surrounding subreddits on this topic, to ask whether closing the subreddit was an effective strategy for content moderation.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="z-index: +1">Conclusion & Outcomes</button>
            <div class="content" style="display: block;">
                <p><strong>We found that the content of other subreddits on the topic became more similar to r/proED following its closure. This suggest that closing a forum is not an effective strategy of moderation.</strong></p>

              <p>We examined the following subreddits on the topic of eating disorders, chosen for their size at time of analysis: r/proED, r/EatingDisorders, r/fuckeatingdisorders, r/EDAnonymous. These posts underwent several pre-processing steps including spell-correction, lemmatization, and forum-specific abbreviation or convention filtering.</p>
              <p>Using pre-trained GLoVE embeddings, we created vector representations of forum posts.</p>
              <p>With these vector embeddings, we conducted Latent Semnatic Analysis, testing various topic amounts for interpretibility.</p>
              <p>We dimensionality reduced these embeddings using t-SNE to project them onto 2-dimensional space for visualization.</p>
              <p>Jensen-Shannon divergence distribution was analyzed on all the tokens for posts grouped by r/proED belonging.</p>
              <p>A logistic regression classifying posts by r/proED belonging by their vector representation/post embedding was conducted and whose misattribution results can be found above.</p>
